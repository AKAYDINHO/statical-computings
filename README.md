## Concept: K-Means Clustering

K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into a pre-determined number of 'k' clusters. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of 'k' groups based on the features provided. The data points are clustered based on feature similarity.

## Scripts

This repository contains the following scripts:

- `kmeans_clustering.py`: A Python script using the `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib` libraries to perform and visualize K-Means clustering.
- `kmeans_clustering.R`: An R script using base R functions and the `ggplot2` library to perform and visualize K-Means clustering.

### Running the Python Script

To run the Python script, you need to have Python installed with the `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib` libraries. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib
```

Then, run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python kmeans_clustering.py
```

### Running the R Script

To run the R script, you need to have R installed with the `ggplot2` library. You can install it by running the following command in your R console:

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Then, you can run the script from your R environment or using `Rscript` from the command line:

```bash
Rscript kmeans_clustering.R
```
